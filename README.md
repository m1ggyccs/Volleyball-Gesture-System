# Volleyball Referee Hand Signals Detection

A web application that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and interpret volleyball referee hand signals in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time video feed from webcam
- Hand signal detection using YOLO, MediaPipe, and LSTM
- Live confidence scoring
- Clean and intuitive user interface

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- TypeScript
- YOLO (for object detection)
- MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
- LSTM (for sequence prediction)
